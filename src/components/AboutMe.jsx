          <p>Hi, I'm Cristian, I'm passionate about the technology and software development. I started my career studying Business, where I acquired solid knowledge in business and management.

Currently, I changed my academic focus to computer science, where I already have the Full Stack Developer certificate and I am studying a technical degree in computer science. 
        <br />
        <br />
        This transition has allowed me to immerse myself in the world of programming and software development.

        I have solid English skills since I had the opportunity to work in Customer Service for 8 months in the United States. I am currently taking a technical English course for IT professionals.

        I am competent in several languages and tools, including: JavaScript, React, Node, Express, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, GIT.
        <br />
        <br />

        I am excited about the future opportunities that await me in the software development field and am looking forward to contributing to the success of technology teams and projects.
